Description: =============================================================
        android-debian-builder -- bootstrap a Debian system in a file
        =============================================================
        
        This tool uses Multistrap_ to bootstrap a Debian (or Debian-based) system into
        an image file as well as adding an Android-targeted launcher script to chroot
        into the system.
        
        Installation
        ============
        Requirements on the host system:
        
        * Python_ 3.3 or up
        * Jinja_ 2.7 or up
        * Multistrap_
        * because of Multistrap: a Debian_ (or Debian-based) system
        
        Requirements on the target device:
        
        * root access
        * Busybox (this might be pre-installed on your system or you could use one of
          the various installers on the Play Store)
        * a kernel that supports loop mounts and whatever file system you wish to use
        
        Installation with *pip*::
        
            # pip3 install android-debian-builder
        
        Installation from the source tarball::
        
            # python3 setup.py install
        
        Usage
        =====
        Simply running ``android-debian-builder`` (as root) will start building a Debian
        image in the current directory. To see possible command line options, run
        ``android-debian-builder --help``. Usually, you'll want to customise the
        configuration; the easiest way is to dump the default configuration with
        ``android-debian-builder --print-config`` and build your own based on that.
        
        Additional example configurations are included. These can be found in
        ``android_debian_builder/examples`` in the source distribution or in the
        ``examples` subdirectory of the installed package. To include one of these
        examples in your configuration setup, prefix the file name with
        ``builtin:examples/`` on the command line, like so::
        
            # android-debian-builder --config builtin:examples/jessie-armhf.cfg
